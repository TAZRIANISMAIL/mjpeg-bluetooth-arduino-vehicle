# Brief description #

This project contains source code for a C# application (requiring .NET Framework 4.5 or newer)which was written to control a Arduino based vehicle with the help of serial Bluetooth connection. Optionally an MJPEG streamer camera may be mounted on the vehicle (the easiest method is to use an Android phone with the free app "IP Webcam" available in the Play Store).

## Documentation ##

Documentation is included in the application in form of comments in the code, ToolTip (hover your mouse over any item inside the running application) and a Help File (opened by a button inside the application).
